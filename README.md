### Objective

Develop a career services application for students.

### Project Description

Hiremap is an online carrier platform aiming to simplify the process of securing or publishing job postings. This service-based platform allows job-seeking candidates to create and modify their portfolios, to eventually apply to various jobs of interest available on the website. The job-hunting process is further simplified by using the provided filtering keyword system. Hiremap additionally provides recruiters the ability to post jobs and the advantage of filtering potential candidates using a similar selection system.
